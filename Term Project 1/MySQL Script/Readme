My raw data are Restaurant ratings in Mexico by real consumers from 2012 from Mavenan Alytics Data Playground.
The raw data contain 5 tables: Consumers, Consumer Preference, Restaurants, Restaurant Cuisine, and Ratings.
In addition to given ID number of consumers/restaurants, the data also include location, service the restaurants provide, living habits, and budget/price, etc.   
Thus, I would like to know:
1. If the cuisine provided by restaurant and the preference of consumers are the same, how's the rating of the restaurants? Are those consumer satisfied with food?
  By creating analytical data store and use stored procedures to select spesific cuisine/preference.
2. If the price levels are (or not) meet the budgets of consumers, Would consumers be satisfied with food, service, and overall of the restaurants?
  By creating another analytical data store and use another stored procedures to select each price level.
3. If restaurants offer (or don't offer) alcohol, What are the genaral ratings from consumers who like to drink and who seldom drink, respectively?
  By creating a data marts with views and select it under conditions.

Between 2 and 3, I have triggers to update analytical data stores if there is any new ratings.
